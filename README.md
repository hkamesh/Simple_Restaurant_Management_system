# Simple_Restaurant_Management_system
This C program simulates a restaurant order management system using a queue for placing orders (FIFO) and a stack for processing them in the kitchen (LIFO), allowing users to place, process, and view orders interactively.


## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Place a new food order  
- ✅ Process an order (move from queue to stack)  
- ✅ View all pending orders  
- ✅ View all processed orders  
- ✅ Menu-driven interface  

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Simple_Restaurant_Management_system.c` – Source code containing all logic for the queue and stack operations.

---

## 🔧 Data Structures Used

- **Queue** – For managing pending customer orders (FIFO)  
- **Stack** – For managing processed kitchen orders (LIFO)  
- **Linked List** – Dynamic memory allocation for orders  

---

## 📥 How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc Simple_Restaurant_Management_system.c -o restaurant_system
./restaurant_system
```

---

## 📸 Sample Menu Interface

```
1. Place an Order  
2. Process an Order  
3. View Pending Orders  
4. View Processed Orders  
5. Exit
```
